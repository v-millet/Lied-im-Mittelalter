                <l n="1">I brought up a falcon for more than a year.</l>
                <l n="2">When I had him tamed as I wanted</l>
                <l n="3">And when I had adorned his feathers with gold,</l>
                <l n="4">He raised himself up high and flew to another land.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="2">
                <l n="1">Since then I have seen the falcon flying:</l>
                <l n="2">He was wearing silken jesses on his feet,</l>
                <l n="3">And his feathers were all red-gold.</l>
                <l n="4">May God bring together those who want to love each other!</l>
